## Description
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license--blue)

    It takes input in the command line from the user, and creates a card based on the information about the employee provided. After the information is inputed, it then appends to the information into a card on an HTML page so that the user can view it in a nice, clean manner.
## Installation
    You'll have to run an npm install and an npm install inquirer. 
 ## Usage
    I want it to be used to create a collection of employee cards for future employers to keep track of their teams better.
## Test Installation
    No
